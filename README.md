traverse_this_town.py contains the classes Node, Graph, and GraphSearch and the driver code to test the methods contained within. 

This graph plus a random graph of 100 nodes was used for these tests.

Because the graph's edges were random in the second test, the DFS methods often could not find a path from one node to another. This is one example of a time that it worked.
