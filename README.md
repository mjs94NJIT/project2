traverse_this_town.py contains the classes Node, Graph, and GraphSearch and the driver code to test the methods contained within. 

This graph plus a random graph of 100 nodes was used for these tests.

Because the graph's edges were random in the second test, the DFS methods often could not find a path from one node to another. This is one example of a time that it worked.

thank_you_vertex includes the graph DirectedGraph

i_node_you_want_me.py cointains the class WeightedGraph. it tests Dijkstra's algortim with this graph:

when_you_wish_upon_astar.py contains the class ad testing for A* search. there is no predetermined test graph for this class.
